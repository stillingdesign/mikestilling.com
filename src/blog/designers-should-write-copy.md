Whether or not designers should code has been covered quite extensively, but what if this whole time we were focused on the wrong thing?

Especially if one of our main gripes as designers is that we donâ€™t have a seat at the table? How does coding factor into the initial work that goes into strategizing and planning projects?

More often than not, designers tend to be a skilled set of hands executing the ideas that marketing, sales, project managers, and/or product managers come up with. In this scenario, a designerâ€™s autonomy equates to the tolerance for visual embellishment that these directors/stakeholders have.

## Why should anyone listen to designers?

Currently, there is no great reason for any other department to take meaningful advice or direction from design. And why should they? We make pictures and change colors, fonts, and button sizes. What do we know about finding strategic ways to increase revenue?

In contrast to engineers, typically, we donâ€™t actually make anything. This means we donâ€™t get to naysay other peopleâ€™s ideas on premise, plausibility, and functionality alone. Nor do we tend to have a well-founded opinion in that conversation.

Beyond all of that, we have continually reduced our worth by caring about extremely silly things. For instance, how often have you heard designers talk about naming Figma layers? Or design tokens? Or design systems ðŸ™ˆâ€¦

Sure, some of those may save time, resulting in the company saving dollars - but in regards to outputs and outcomes, what value do these hold?
