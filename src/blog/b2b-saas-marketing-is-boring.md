## When is last time that you’ve read a traditional blog post from a B2B SaaS company?

I’m not talking about looking at them for inspiration or competitive analysis — like, the last time you just stumbled across a B2B SaaS post in your LinkedIn feed and were like “OoOoOo, this seems extremely interesting and I need to read it…”

If you’ve made it to this point, let’s tack on conversion, did you then sign up for this product at some point or were you already an active user?

How about the messaging used? Was it really B2B or was it B2C? Was it speaking to you or the company that you work for?

My guess is no, you can’t remember, or it was a fringe circumstance, or it never happened at all.
