<p>Do you recall the last time you stumbled upon a blog post about business software and found yourself hooked, not out of obligation but <span class="space:nowrap">genuine interest?</span></p>

**Neither do I.**

I'm not talking about the routine glance at the latest updates from your company or competitors. I'm referring to that magical moment when a social media post, boasting organization-wide benefits, grabs your attention, prompts a click, and before you know it, you're contemplating purchasing <span class="space:nowrap">that software. ü§®</span>

Chances are, this scenario is as elusive for you as it is for most. Let's take it a step further‚Äî<mark>**when was the last <span class="space:nowrap">time you:</span>**</mark>

<div class="w:100p mt:24 sm:mt:36 mb:36 font:serif font:xl sm:font:4xl leading:130 border-t:1 border:white border-opacity:20 border:dashed">
    <ol>
        <li class="pt:16 pb:12 border-b:1 border:white border-opacity:20 border:dashed" >
            <span class="inline-block w:28 sm:w:56" style="color: {{ accent }};">01.</span>
            Clicked on a B2B ad on social media?
        </li>
       <li class="pt:16 pb:12 border-b:1 border:white border-opacity:20 border:dashed">
       <span class="inline-block w:28 sm:w:56" style="color: {{ accent }};">02.</span>
            Engaged with B2B display ads?
        </li>
        <li class="pt:16 pb:12 border-b:1 border:white border-opacity:20 border:dashed">
            <span class="inline-block w:28 sm:w:56" style="color: {{ accent }};">03.</span>
            Delved into B2B marketing emails?
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

It's not that we don't discover interesting things through social media, blogs, ads, or emails. It's just that nearly every marketing effort targeting "enterprises" tends to speak to people in the most <span class="space:nowrap">uninspiring way.</span>

## Unintentionally Lame

Marketers and designers seem to have <mark>unwittingly concluded that individuals working at enterprise-scale companies are inherently dull.</mark> This misstep often takes root while establishing an ideal customer profile and messaging framework. Have you ever come across statements like, "Enterprise buyers care about..."? If so, you're <span class="space:nowrap">not alone.</span>

<figure class="w:100p flex flex:col align-items:center text:center mt:36 mb:18 sm:mb:64">
    <img
        src="/assets/images/blog/marketing-is-boring-harold.webp"
        alt="Hide the pain harold"
        width="640" height="360"
        class="relative w:100p h:auto max-w:none z:1 radius:md sm:radius:lg"
        loading="lazy"
        decoding="async"
    />
    <figcaption class="mb:12 mt:16 sm:mt:24 sm:mb:n32">
        This fictional audience visualized
    </figcaption>
</figure>


These processes often make assumptions about a person's values based on the size of the company that they work for. Once finalized, these documents steer an entire marketing organization toward captivating these fictional <span class="space:nowrap">corporate heads.</span>

### Forgetting Context

We often view our marketing touchpoints in industry and competitive silos, asking questions like, "How does this compare to our competitors?" or "Where does this stand in the greater <span class="space:nowrap">industry landscape?"</span>

While this might work lower in the funnel, after someone has shown interest, it fails to consider everything else that occupies a person's browser and, beyond that, their <span class="space:nowrap">everyday life.</span>

Like it or not, most every piece of marketing competes for attention not just with other businesses but with memes, children, dogs, coworkers, and streaming platforms.

    <figcaption class="mb:12 mt:16 sm:mt:24 sm:mb:n32">
        Which image do you find to be more intriguing?
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<mark>The above image isn‚Äôt a knock on Notion.</mark> Relatively, they put out more interesting looking stuff than most. With that, assumably, most SaaS marketers would be happy with the quality <span class="space:nowrap">of this ad.</span>

<mark>However, when we compare this ad, in context, against the rest of the internet, it starts to seem almost <span class="space:nowrap">comically lame.</span></mark>

### Losing Relevance

Let's assume, on visuals alone, our software-focused content cannot compete with a cowboy on a huge, rearing horse. <span class="space:nowrap">So, what</span> do we have left to connect <span class="space:nowrap">with viewers?</span>

The first thought that comes to mind is relevance. In a world filled with interesting content, rather than distract the viewer, <span class="space:nowrap">our software</span> solves an actual problem <span class="space:nowrap">for them.</span>

**Yes, simple, problem solved üòè...**

<mark>Until we look at how we‚Äôre talking to people about products.</mark> Let's again refer to the Notion ad from above, when's the last time you thought, "I really need to start preparing for this next <span class="space:nowrap">AI wave?"</span> For now, let's imagine that you have. Surely, investing in documentation seems like an obvious <span class="space:nowrap">first step...</span>

</figure>

These leaps in logic are common across B2B SaaS marketing. In an attempt to ‚Äúrelate‚Äù with enterprise audiences, marketers selling tools with obvious functionality will simply claim to solve <span class="space:nowrap">a larger</span> problem that correlates with the target company size. However, during that process, the connection between core functionality and major benefit is <span class="space:nowrap">often lost.</span>

Furthermore, <mark>most enterprise-level benefits are boring, unrelatable, and not unique.</mark> For example, take knowledge management, enhanced collaboration, or security‚Äîdo these subjects truly interest you? Is there a time a time when you were actively trying to solve for these issues without a predetermined solution in mind? If not, was that solution found on social media? Lastly, are there many companies that this type of messaging couldn‚Äôt be used for <span class="space:nowrap">in B2B SaaS?</span>

### But What About Brand Marketing?

Having a predetermined solution in mind was mentioned in the last section, so it's worth addressing <span class="space:nowrap">the thought:</span>

<div class="relative w:100p mt:36 mb:36 pt:32 pb:24 sm:pb:28 border-y:1 border:dashed border:white border-opacity:15">
    <blockquote class="relative w:100p">
        <div class="inline font:serif italic font:2xl sm:font:5xl color:content-i">
            <div class="absolute top:n10 sm:top:n16 left:n24 sm:left:n40 font:7xl sm:font:10xl" style="color: {{ accent }};">‚Äú</div>
            To be identified and remembered as a go-to solution for any specific problem, a brand must be seen at least five <spa class="space:nowrap">to seven times.</span>
            <div class="inline-block font:7xl sm:font:10xl transform translate-y:18 sm:translate-y:24 ml:n10 sm:ml:n12" style="line-height:0; color: {{ accent }};">‚Äù</div>
        </div>
    </blockquote>
</div>

While it's often stated that a brand needs to show up, <mark>how it should show up</mark> is rarely talked about. With that, the design of these interactions seems pivotal in determining whether or not <span class="space:nowrap">a brand</span> is _truly seen_ in the <span class="space:nowrap">first place.</span>

For instance, is the Asana ad above noticeable, let alone, memorable? When targetting a top-of-funnel audience, is this _really_ putting the brand and product's best <span class="space:nowrap">foot forward?</span>

Unfortunately, most B2B SaaS brand marketing has fallen into the same trap‚Äîspeaking to a boring, ficticious enterprise persona. To add to the problem, frequency has been heavily prioritized over quality for these types of impressions. This ramp in frequency and disregard for quality has left viewers with spammy vibes and an increasing numbness toward <span class="space:nowrap">our work.</span>

## Solving for Boring

<mark>Nobody goes to work as a marketer or designer and conciously chooses to make spam.</mark> Despite that, here we are. So, how do we break ourselves out of this cycle? Fortunately, the solution seems pretty straightforward...

### An Honest Look

First, we need to consider whether or not our outputs are indeed lame. If they are, we need to own, acknowledge, and share this idea amongst our team. Facing this can be scary, and potentially offensive, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be solved today. **Start with <span class="space:nowrap">small improvements.**</span>

Sound like common sense? That's cause it is. Oddly enough, somewhere along the way, it seems we have gotten so caught up in industry jargain, tactics, and keep-up that we have foregone <span class="space:nowrap">the basics.</span>

### Simple Decency

We‚Äôve all been frustrated with ads and branded content‚Äîwhether it be their subject, placement, or otherwise. However, how often do we consider if whether or not we are causing this exact same experience <span class="space:nowrap">for others?</span>
