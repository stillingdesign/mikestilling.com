## While moving from PLG to SLG and back again, with <span class="space:nowrap">an evolving </span> product, and fluctuating ICP — Mike was responsibile for finding ways to drive revenue through marketing, brand, and web design at Rewatch.

As the sole designer focused on marketing, this meant Mike <span class="space:nowrap">had to balance</span> efficiency and quality, while prioritizing impact.

### <span class="font:serif italic">on</span> Efficiency

[Rewatch](https://rewatch.com/) generally has around ~20 employees and targets medium or enterprise sized businesses—making it important for the company to "swing up," looking larger than it really is.

Mike's technical background and familiarity with just about every design tool, made it possible to build a lot of stuff, fast so that the team looked larger. The challenge was designing a brand that allowed assets to be designed quickly, while still looking great, and being flexible enough to change with the business.

#### Building&nbsp; <span class="font:serif italic">fast</span>

At any given moment, "good" SaaS branding is fairly predictable. Strapped on time and striving for growth, reinventing this wasn't feasible or conducive to the business goals. Instead, Mike opted to borrow bits and pieces of what currently works for "the cool kids" — brands like [Linear](https://linear.app/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Rewatch's CEO is a fantastic product designer. Running with pieces of his previous work toward the brand also helped shape aspects of what it is today. On the marketing side, feedback centered around making the brand more approachable than it's initial state of being dark and developer focused. Outside of that, most of the team's early feedback was like, "we like Apple..."

Mike reached for what was quickly achievable and balanced between the different stakeholders, clean typography and lots of white space. By removing the "dark mode" first approach to the brand, everything felt a bit friendlier and easier to digest.

For the final touches, Mike looked toward the product for direction. Thankfully, Rewatch's product design team is top notch. To increase uniformity, Mike pulled the primary color, grayscale, button stylings, and font-family from the product.

#### <span class="font:serif italic">under</span> the hood

Mike also designed, built, and managed Rewatch's marketing website. He chose tools that made building quick and flexible, while straightforward enough for the product folks to dive into, if help was ever needed.

To accomplish this, he used [Eleventy](http://11ty.dev) as an SSG, with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for templating, and [UniformCSS](https://uniformcss.com/) as a utility framework; resulting in markup that was nearly identical to the product's front-end. This enabled collaboration from the product team along with the ability to design in code — which saves the team a lot of time during the page creation process.

Since CMS's often promote over-templatization, Mike and the team opted to only rollout CMS functionality in places where it was absolutely needed, such as the blog and changelog. Mike used Netlify CMS (now Decap), as a minimalist solution. Being Git-based and writing to markdown, this CMS fit well with the existing content structure.

### <span class="font:serif italic">on</span> Quality

Moving extremely fast will lead to sloppiness. It's inevitable. At some point, there will be work that is not as great as it could be. At Rewatch, Mike tried to minimize this by taking a thoughtful approach to visual direction.

While it's not always the flashiest route, minimalism paired with straightforward messaging that's easily understood works. Making this approach look good isn't too challenging either. Circling back: clean typography, lots of whitespace.

#### Benefits <span class="font:serif italic">vs.</span> features

Landing on messaging was a consistent challenge at Rewatch. As a tiny, series A company targetting much larger businesses, the team often looked toward giants for direction. This approach yielded the appeal of benefits based messaging.

As a designer, benefits based messaging is a nightmare when used on a product that most people are unfamiliar with. For instance, imagine trying to express or visualize "Work better, together" — but not for Slack or Teams. Frankly, this route was just confusing. While design could be visually appealing, it was not meaningful, comprehendable, or effective.

To advocate against it and change direction, Mike pointed to analytics. Analytics showed success where simple feature-based messaging was implemented. He'd also create "spikes" that visualized how a specific project could look if the feature-based approach was taken instead.

Slowly, but surely, the team began to see the benefits of feature-based messaging and it was adopted. As such, conversion rates increased, creative became clearer, and viewers were able to comprehend the product, faster.

### <span class="font:serif italic">Prioritizing</span> impact

How we spend our time is always a tradeoff. To actively focus on "X" means not focusing on "Y" — and, when there's an endless pile of work in front of us, it's easy to lose sight of this.

To add to this, most mainstream marketing practices today promote quantity over quality, think content or account-based marketing. These tactics add to that pile while often further distracting from what is likely a more fundamental hurdle in selling software.

#### <span class="font:serif italic">Focus</span> on the fundies

Historically, Rewatch has ran a lot of ads, published a lot of content, and spent a lot of time optimizing it's G2 page. If we're being honest, way too much for what it's gotten in return.

This lack of result made Mike start questioning the value in a lot of the work being asked of him. Like, who is actually convinced to buy software from a corny social post with a bunch of G2 badges? Or, do we honestly think people want to read another B2B SaaS blog post? Even if these ads get clicked, what in the hell makes a "knowledge engine" and how does Rewatch actually "enable video collaboration"?

A handful of core pages on Rewatch's website were organically getting more direct traffic than most of the LPs paid ads were driving to, especially LPs driven to from paid social. However, the conversion rate on these pages was abismal. (re-enter benefit vs. feature-based messaging)

By simply hitting an industry standard conversion rate on these pages, Rewatch could nearly 2x sign-ups. Mike shifted his focus toward these pages and began advocating that the team allocate time toward rebuilding them. Analytics again came to the rescue for getting buy-in.

Starting with the most visited page, the homepage, Mike re-built the core pages of the site with a mission to better communicate the fundamental aspects/functionality of the product. Upon completion, this lead to an increase in sign-ups, qualified sales leads, and ARR.

### <span class="font:serif italic">Key</span> Takeaways

Throughout Mike's ~2 years at Rewatch, he has grown a lot as a designer, developer, and director. A few key takeaways from his time there are:

#### First, nail the basics

Whether it's design, development, or marketing — the fundamental aspects of anything are what matter most. Make sure they work before building on top of them.

#### Simple works

At one point, Mike tried building out 3D UI mocks like Microsoft Fluent uses... It was a lot, and a total flop. He reverted to regular 1:1 UI mocks and they looked just as good. In summary, simple doesn't mean boring or ugly. Usually it's easier to build well and understand anyway.

#### Marketing is part of the job

Just like designers get ideas and feedback from their friends in marketing, marketers should be getting ideas and feedback from folks in design. As creators, we have the unique ability to build ideas outside of a word doc, take advantage of that.
